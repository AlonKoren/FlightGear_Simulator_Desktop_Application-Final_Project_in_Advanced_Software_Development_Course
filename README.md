## Introduction

In this project, I developed a desktop application (using Java and JavaFX) for an open source simulator, FlightGear.<br />
The project was based on five milestones that were made during this year.

## Explanation about the milestones in the project

#### Milestones 1-3

At these milestones the goal was building a server-side project from top to bottom, which gets search problems from the client and returns the "best" solution according to the search algorithms.<br />
While using the following elements:
* Having an emphasis on the right use on Solid, Grasp and Design Patterns principles.
* An extended use in Java Generics.
* Building a Server, Cache Manager and a Client Handler as interfaces,opened to a variety of uses by demand.
* Building a variety of algorithms such as A-star, BestFirstSearch, BFS and DFS in order to solve several problems.
* Building a single Adapter for the project, in order to solve different unexpected problems.

#### Milestone 4
The goal in this milestone was to write an interpreter for a code that controls an unmanned aircraft.<br />
This simulator is also a server that can be connected as a client (and also as a server).<br />
This allows us to easily retrieve information about the various flight parameters in real time and even inject commands to fly the aircraft.

#### Milestone 5
The goal in this milestone was to build and design a GUI for the flight simulator using JavaFX and MVVM architecture, to calculate the flight route and fly the plane using the previous milestones.

## This project contains the following elements
* Use of design and architecture Patterns.
* Client-server communication and architecture.
* Use of data structures and database.
* Streaming data (files & communications).
* Comparison, selection and implementation of algorithms within the system.
* Parallel programming using Threads.
* Event-oriented programming, desktop application with GUI.
